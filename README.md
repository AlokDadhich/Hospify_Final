# 🏥 Hospify – Real-Time Hospital Resource Visibility Platform

**Hospify** is a real-time hospital resource visibility platform built with a clear mission: **no one should suffer due to a lack of information during medical emergencies.**

## ⚠️ The Data Transparency Problem

In today’s world, **hospitals rarely share real-time availability of critical resources** — such as ICU beds, oxygen-supported beds, and ambulances — unless specifically requested by the government.

This is a major setback. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many institutions publicly released such data, enabling real-time dashboards and saving thousands of lives. But as the crisis faded, **data-sharing practices have been rolled back**, and the public is once again left in the dark.

Hospify is a solution — but it needs more than code. It needs participation.
